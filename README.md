This blog is made by Jekyll and Young (@chillinyoung) wrote template from scratch. For easy blog posting, we are using Bear note App as text editor and collecting local data from local db and converting data into .md. I refered the idea from https://github.com/andymatuschak/Bear-Markdown-Export, which is getting note data from sqlite.db. Most of the processes are getting automated.

### What we are using
- Bear app
- Jekyll
- HTML and SCSS
- a little bit of Vanilla JS
- Python

### What We've Done
- [x] Getting Local DB and Parsing data as .json
- [x] Cleaning Data and make .md files in the designated _post folder
- [x] Collecting image paths and copy them to proper jekyll assets folder

### More to do
- [x] CRUD pages based on db data
- [x] CRUD by comparing db data and saved data
- [ ] MacOS UI

### What We've Learned from it
- looked into the db data and reviewed basic sql query
- got familiar with regex
