# chillinjae.github.io

This blog is made by Jekyll and Young (@chillinyoung) wrote template from scratch.
For easy blog posting, we are using Bear App and collecting local data and converting data into .md.
I refered the idea from https://github.com/andymatuschak/Bear-Markdown-Export, which is getting note data from sqlite.db.

### What we are using
- Bear app
- Jekyll
- HTML and SCSS
- a little bit of Vanilla JS
- Python

### What We've Learned from it
- looked into the db data and reviewed basic sql query
- got familiar with regex
