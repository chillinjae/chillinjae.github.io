I'm taking TRU Math 1701 (discrete math) but they don't offer any related video classes. They just give me a path to study. So, I just found some related course to learn. It's a bit deeper but it's great I guess. Planning to take other math classes. I took most of the engineering math classes but it was about 15 years ago.


## Teach yourself CS
- [Teach youtself CS Link](https://teachyourselfcs.com/)

From one of the newsletter I'm **subscribing**, I found this valuable link. I've been thought to make a list like this to teach myself CS, so I'm considering translating this in Korean.
