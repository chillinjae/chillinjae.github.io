[6.0001](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63WbdFxL8giv4yhgdMGaZNA)  [6.0002](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP619EG1wp0kT-7rDE_Az5TNd)
<br>

### Course overview
This course is focusing on introducing programming concepts and basic algorithms. It has a similar position with CS50 of Harvard but I felt that it’s more related to my purpose in order to check if any missing parts on python programming. 
<br>

Lecture is available on both Youtube and edX. I like Youtube version more though. Assignment and exam is similar but edX version is a bit easier than offline class materials. So I tried to take both.
<br>

### What I learned
* 6.0001 is ~~almost~~ done
Reviewed python basics
-> syntax, datatype, class and a little of complexity and sort algorithms
* 6.0002 just looked through videos on Youtube.
* didn’t do the class on the Edx, so I lost 10% of points but I guess I can pass it as A enough. 
* Homework on Edx is not bad overall. It’s a bit easy though.
* I spent just 2-3 hours per week to see the lecture on youtube and do assignment, but it depends on how familiar with python you are.
<br>

### What I’m going to do next
* 6.006
