title: Change Jekyll to Hugo
date: 2021-01-31

<br>

Jekyll had some issues with MD to HTML parser, so we found other static site generators. We considered Hugo and Gatsby, and decided to go with Hugo. There are several reasons why.
<br>

* faster
* simple
* less dependency (less plugins though)
<br>

Template is cleaned and Young made it as Hugo-theme. Bear-exporter (it is named as Pizzly now ðŸ¤©)  is also applied all differences. 
<br>

Gatsby looks great but seems much similar to Wordpress. Iâ€™ll consider using it when I need more complex websites than blog.
