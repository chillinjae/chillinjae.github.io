# Hello, I’m Jae 😁
🔭 I’m working as TD in Vancouver, especially focusing on the lighting. I also keep learning CS and Math to be a better engineer in the industry through the materials from everywhere.  All of this journey started from a tiny step of python scripting while working as lighter. Hope that I can go deeper inside and contribute for the artists, industry and the communities.
