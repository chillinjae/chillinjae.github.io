# Hello, I’m Jae 😁
🔭 I’m working at the animation studio as pipeline TD, especially focusing on the lighting and compositing side. I also keep learning CS for being better engineer in this industry through the materials from all around the world.  All of this journey started from a tiny step of python scripting while working as lighter. Hope that I can go deeper inside and contribute for the artists, industry and the communities.
