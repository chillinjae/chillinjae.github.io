### Course overview
This course is focusing on introducing programming concepts and basic algorithms. It has a similar position with CS50 of Harvard but I felt that it’s more related to my purpose which is checking if any missing parts on python programming. 
<br>

Lecture is available on both Youtube and edX. I like Youtube version more though. Assignment and exam is similar but edX version is a bit easier than offline class materials. So I tried to take both.
