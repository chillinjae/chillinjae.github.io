      <description>I‚Äôve taken 2 weeks of break before starting new role, and it was actually only for getting this result. I just worried a bit and it‚Äôs not fully satisfying but now I can apply for the bachelor level of studies :) hope I can start new studies in the local colleges.

      <description>[COMPLETED]
Materials Computational Thinking using Python XSeries Program | edX
6.0001 6.0002
Course overview This course is focusing on introducing programming concepts and basic algorithms. It has a similar position with CS50 of Harvard but I felt that it‚Äôs more related to my purpose in order to check if any missing parts on python programming.
Lecture is available on both Youtube and edX. I like Youtube version more though. Assignment and exam is similar but edX version is a bit easier than offline class materials.</description>

      <title>Change Jekyll to Hugo</title>

      <description>Jekyll had some issues with MD to HTML parser, so we found other static site generators. We considered Hugo and Gatsby, and decided to go with Hugo. There are several reasons why.
 faster simple less dependency (less plugins though)
  Template is cleaned and Young made it as Hugo-theme. Bear-exporter (it is named as Pizzly now ü§©) is also applied all differences. Gatsby looks great but seems much similar to Wordpress.</description>

      <description>Hello, I‚Äôm Jae üòÅ üî≠ I‚Äôm working at the animation studio as pipeline TD, especially focusing on the lighting and compositing side. I also keep learning CS for being better engineer in this industry through the materials from all around the world. All of this journey started from a tiny step of python scripting while working as lighter. Hope that I can go deeper inside and contribute for the artists, industry and the communities.</description>
