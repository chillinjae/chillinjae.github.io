      <title>Change Jekyll to Hugo</title>

      <description>Jekyll had some issues with MD to HTML parser, so we found other static site generators. We considered Hugo and Gatsby, and decided to go with Hugo. There are several reasons why.
 faster simple less dependency (less plugins though)
  Template is cleaned and Young made it as Hugo-theme. Bear-exporter (it is named as Pizzly now ü§©) is also applied all differences.
Gatsby looks great but seems much similar to Wordpress.</description>

      <description>Today I read a blog post about success story of self taught. There are a lot of similar stories about being developer, but as mentioned in the post, most of them are mostly focused on the web development and saying about the good courses or useful materials.
‚ÄÉHowever, for me, I‚Äôm gonna focusing on the computer graphics and algorithms, so I just wondered if there are similar cases. This is a one of the case and it‚Äôs very impressive as she studied lots of courses I‚Äôm planning to do.</description>
